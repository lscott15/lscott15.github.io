## The idea
The first thing that got me turned onto the idea of making my own custom keyboard was the kickstarter for a keyboard called the [Whitefox](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lekashman/whitefox-mechanical-keyboard). I wasn't psyched about the prospect of waiting 6-9 months for the keyboard though and ended up embarking on a mission to design and build my own.
